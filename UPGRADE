Upgrade from 1.0 to 2.0
=======================

Lime 2 is (nearly) entirely backwards compatible the first version. If you
want to upgrade a project that is already using Lime 1, you have to follow
only a few steps to replace it by the new release.


Installing Lime 2.0
-------------------

To install Lime 2 in a project, you simply need to download or checkout the
source into a directory of your project.

With Subversion:

    > svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/tools/lime/tags/RELEASE_2_0_0_ALPHA1 lib/vendor/Lime2
    
This command will checkout a copy of Lime 2 into the directory `lib/vendor/Lime2`.
You can also install Lime in a different directory, just make sure that you
use the right path in the next steps.


Replacing Lime 1.0 by 2.0
-------------------------

If you use symfony, Lime 1 is usually installed in the directory 
`path/to/symfony/lib/vendor/lime`. To use Lime 2 instead, you need to replace 
its `lime.php` file by a link to `path/to/Lime2/lib/lime.php`.

The next commands assume that:

  * symfony is installed in `lib/vendor/symfony`
  * Lime 2 is installed in `lib/vendor/Lime2`
  
Adjust the paths to match your project's paths if necessary.

On Linux:

    > cd lib/vendor/symfony/lib/vendor/lime
    > mv lime.php lime.php.1.0
    > ln -s ../../../../Lime2/lib/lime.php lime.php
    
On Windows:

Not tested yet. Please contact me if you found a working solution.

Now symfony will always use Lime 2 when running any tests.
